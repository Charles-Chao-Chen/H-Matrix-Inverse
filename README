This project aims at implementing a fast algorithm to 
 invert a weakly dmissible hierarchical matrix. The future plan
 may be to use the inverse as the initial guess for
 Newton's iteration which converges to the inverse
 of a strong admissible hierarchical matrix.

Note: the code uses Eigen linear algebra library:
 http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
 change the EIGEN path in test/Makefile to run
 the tests.

TO run the test:
 cd test/
 make
 ./solve
