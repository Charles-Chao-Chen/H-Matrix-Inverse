This project aims at implementing a fast algorithm to 
 inverse a weak-admissible h-matrix. The future plan
 may be to use the inverse as the initial guess for
 Newton's iteration which converges to the inverse
 of a strong-admissible h-matrix.

Note: this code uses Eigen linear algebra library:
 http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
 change the EIGEN variable in test/Makefile to run
 the tests.

TO run the test:
 cd test/
 make
 ./solve
