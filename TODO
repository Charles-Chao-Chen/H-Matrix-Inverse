- implement my own z-order scheme using interlacing bits.
   There are also nice code online for reference.

- use the low accuracy solver as preconditioner

- time the code with different ranks.

- implement maxRank as the upper bound for off-diagonal blocks

- make computeLowRank_SVD() accept eps as a varaible

- implement templated Point class and Rect class for 1D, 2D and 3D

- extend the solver to 1D (easy) and 3D (recursivly call 1D solve
   for HIERARCHY node)
