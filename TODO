- implement my own z-order scheme using interlacing bits.
   There are also nice code online for reference.

- Done: use the low accuracy solver as preconditioner

- time the code with different ranks.

- Done: implement maxRank as the upper bound for off-diagonal blocks

- Giveup: make computeLowRank_SVD() accept eps as a varaible
   Reason: changed plan to use maxRank as parameter and 
           set SVD_ZERO_TOL and SVD_RANK_TOL in macros.hpp

- implement templated Point class and Rect class for 1D, 2D and 3D

- extend the solver to 1D (easy) and 3D (recursivly call 1D solve
   for HIERARCHY node)
